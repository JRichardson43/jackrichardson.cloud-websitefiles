Whether it’s cutting-edge technology, strategic brilliance, or the pure thrill of competition, motorsport fuels my enthusiasm and connects me with a global community of fans and teams.</p>
                    <h3>IT and Technology</h3>
                        <p>Technology is at the core of my curiosity and creativity. I’m passionate about exploring all aspects of IT, from the complexities of infrastructure to the transformative potential of generative AI, like the tools I use every day. Among my interests, security stands out as a critical focus, where I’m driven to understand and address the challenges of safeguarding digital environments in an ever-evolving technological landscape.</p>
