                <h3>Hosting Websites on AWS</h3>
                <p>While the website you’re viewing is not hosted on AWS, I’ve successfully hosted multiple websites on the platform. This hands-on experience has strengthened my expertise in key AWS services, including CloudFront, S3, EC2, IIS, and Load Balancing. Additionally, I’ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and other web development technologies, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the technical and operational aspects of website hosting and creation. This project reflects my ability to manage scalable, secure, and efficient web infrastructures.</p>

                <h3>Automating AWS Operations with Lambda</h3>
                <p>To optimize resource usage and reduce costs, I designed a serverless solution using AWS Lambda. Recognizing the need for EC2 instances to run only during specific periods, such as company working hours (8:00 AM to 5:00 PM), I implemented two Lambda functions to automate instance management. These functions, triggered by CloudWatch Events, efficiently start and stop instances at the appropriate times. This project highlights my ability to leverage AWS serverless technologies to create cost-effective and automated solutions tailored to operational needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Developing a Packet Sniffer in Python</h3>
                <p>To enhance my networking and programming skills, I built a packet sniffer using Python's socket module. By configuring the socket to capture packets directly from the network, I created scripts to extract and analyze the captured data. This project not only sharpened my understanding of network protocols but also provided valuable hands-on experience in cybersecurity concepts. It showcases my ability to combine programming and networking knowledge to tackle complex technical challenges.</p>
