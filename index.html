                <h3>Hosting Websites on AWS</h3>
                <p>While the website you’re viewing is not hosted on AWS, I’ve successfully hosted multiple websites on the platform. This hands-on experience has strengthened my expertise in key AWS services, including CloudFront, S3, EC2, IIS, and Load Balancing. Additionally, I’ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and other web development technologies, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the technical and operational aspects of website hosting and creation. This project reflects my ability to manage scalable, secure, and efficient web infrastructures.</p>
